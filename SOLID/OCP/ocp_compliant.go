/*
The PaymentProcessor interface defines a contract for payment methods, allowing different payment methods (e.g., CreditCard, PayPal) to implement their own Process method.
The PaymentService class is now closed for modification because you donâ€™t need to change it to support new payment methods. It's open for extension since you can add new payment types (e.g., Bitcoin, Google Pay) by simply creating new structs that implement the PaymentProcessor interface.
